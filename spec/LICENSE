## THE CODE - Moral Foundation

*"Never violate a woman, nor harm a child.
Do not lie, cheat or steal. These things are for lesser men.
Protect the weak against the evil strong and never allow thoughts of gain to lead you into the pursuit of evil.
Never back away from an enemy, either fight or surrender.
It is not enough to say I will not be evil, evil must be fought wherever it is found."*

**— David Gemmell, The Drenai Code**
